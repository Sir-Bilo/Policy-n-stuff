    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how this app ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects information during your use of this app. This app is privately owned and operated, and all collected data is handled exclusively by its owner. The app is provided for personal testing purposes only.</p>

    <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>This app may collect limited data during testing, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="section-title">Authorization Code:</span> The code provided by the OAuth provider to enable authentication.</li>
        <li><span class="section-title">Access Token:</span> A token that temporarily allows access to limited parts of your account.</li>
        <li><span class="section-title">Basic Profile Data:</span> Information you explicitly grant access to, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Username</li>
                <li>Public profile information</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This app does not collect sensitive or unnecessary data and does not store any collected data persistently.</p>

    <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>Collected information is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authenticate your account for testing OAuth functionality.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate the app's features in a private testing environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your data is not used for any commercial purposes or shared with third parties.</p>

    <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>Your information is never shared with external parties except as required by the OAuth provider (e.g., for authentication).</p>

    <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
    <p>All data is deleted immediately after the testing session ends. No persistent storage of data occurs.</p>

    <h3>6. Security</h3>
    <p>Reasonable security measures are implemented to protect your data during testing. However, as this is a private testing application, it is not intended for production use, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
    <p>Since this app is for private testing only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have full control over what data is shared through the OAuth provider.</li>
        <li>You can revoke access at any time through the settings of the OAuth provider.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is unlikely to change. However, any updates will be communicated directly to you as the owner of the app.</p>

    <h3>9. Contact</h3>
    <p>For any questions, concerns, or clarifications, please contact the app owner directly.</p>
